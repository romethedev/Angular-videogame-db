# Angular-videogame-db

This project is a SPA database of video games that utilizes a public API to generate all the information for each game including: Name, Genre, Platforms, Publisher, and much more.

I used this project to practice using Angular CLI, making http calls, creating services, and http interceptors. This project also includes a demonstration on how to set up routes and pass data between components, pipes, and angular directives like ngFor, ngIf, and more.

This database includes cards of a wide range of games showing its info, a search bar, as well as a filter dropdown. When a card is clicked it will navigate to that specific game's page showing even more information such as its metacritic rating, screenshots, a link to the game website, and even trailers.
